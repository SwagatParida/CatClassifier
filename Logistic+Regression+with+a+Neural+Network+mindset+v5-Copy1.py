# # Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
#
#
#
# **Instructions:**
# - Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
#


# ## 1 - Packages ##
#
# - [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
# - [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
# - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
# - [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.

# ## 2 - Overview of the Problem set ##
#
# **Problem Statement**: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:
#     - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
#     - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
#     - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).
#
# Build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
#
# Let's get more familiar with the dataset. Load the data by running the following code.



# Loading the data (cat/non-cat)
train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()


# Add "_orig" at the end of image datasets (train and test) because we are going to preprocess them. After preprocessing, we will end up with train_set_x and test_set_x (the labels train_set_y and test_set_y don't need any preprocessing).
#
# Each line of your train_set_x_orig and test_set_x_orig is an array representing an image. You can visualize an example by running the following code. Feel free also to change the `index` value and re-run to see other images.

# In[76]:

# Example of a picture
index = 25
plt.imshow(train_set_x_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(train_set_y[0, index]) + ", it's a '" + classes[np.squeeze(train_set_y[0, index])].decode("utf-8") +  "' picture.")


# Many software bugs in deep learning come from having matrix/vector dimensions that don't fit.
#
#  Find the values for:
#     - m_train (number of training examples)
#     - m_test (number of test examples)
#     - num_px (= height = width of a training image)
# Remember that `train_set_x_orig` is a numpy-array of shape (m_train, num_px, num_px, 3). For instance, you can access `m_train` by writing `train_set_x_orig.shape[0]`.

# In[77]:

###
m_train = train_set_y.shape[1]
m_test = test_set_y.shape[1]
num_px = test_set_x_orig[0].shape[0]
###

print ("Number of training examples: m_train = " + str(m_train))
print ("Number of testing examples: m_test = " + str(m_test))
print ("Height/Width of each image: num_px = " + str(num_px))
print ("Each image is of size: (" + str(num_px) + ", " + str(num_px) + ", 3)")

print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))
print ("test_set_x shape: " + str(test_set_x_orig.shape))
print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape))


# </table>
#

# For convenience, reshape images of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) in a numpy-array of shape (num_px $*$ num_px $*$ 3, 1). After this, our training (and test) dataset is a numpy-array where each column represents a flattened image. There should be m_train (respectively m_test) columns.
#
# Reshape the training and test data sets so that images of size (num_px, num_px, 3) are flattened into single vectors of shape (num\_px $*$ num\_px $*$ 3, 1).
#
# A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b$*$c$*$d, a) is to use:
# ```python
# X_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape[0], -1).T      # X.T is the transpose of X
# ```

# In[78]:

# Reshape the training and test examples

test_set_x_flatten = test_set_x_orig.reshape(test_set_x_orig.shape[0],-1).T
###

print ("train_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(train_set_x_flatten.shape))
print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))
print ("test_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(test_set_x_flatten.shape))
print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape))
print ("sanity check after reshaping: " + str(train_set_x_flatten[0:5,0]))

# ### 4.1 - Helper functions
#
# **Exercise**: Using your code from "Python Basics", implement `sigmoid()`. As you've seen in the figure above, you need to compute $sigmoid( w^T x + b) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w^T x + b)}}$ to make predictions. Use np.exp().

# - You have initialized your parameters.

#

# You can see the cost decreasing. It shows that the parameters are being learned. However, you see that you could train the model even more on the training set. Try to increase the number of iterations in the cell above and rerun the cells. You might see that the training set accuracy goes up, but the test set accuracy goes down. This is called overfitting.

# ## 6 - Further analysis (optional/ungraded exercise) ##
#
#
# #### Choice of learning rate ####
#
# **Reminder**:
# In order for Gradient Descent to work you must choose the learning rate wisely. The learning rate $\alpha$  determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may "overshoot" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.
#
# Let's compare the learning curve of our model with several choices of learning rates. Run the cell below. This should take about 1 minute. Feel free also to try different values than the three we have initialized the `learning_rates` variable to contain, and see what happens.
